-- conditional evaluation is done with the '?' operator
-- it takes an expression on its left and a list of two expressions on its right

-- if the left expression is true, the first expression in the right is evaluated
-- if the left expression is false, the second expression in the right is evaluated

-- everything is true, except for the number 0

-- a is 9
a: 3 < 4 ? [9, 8];

-- b is 8
b: 3 > 4 ? [9, 8];
