-- heres a problem for you
a: [1, 2, 3];
b: a;

pop @ [b];

-- what is a?


-- that's right, its [1, 2]
-- functions like pop, push, and set mutate the list
-- and assigning lists by reference does not duplicate the list

-- to remedy this problem, there is the 'dup' function
-- it takes any value and duplicates it

a: [1, 2, 3];
b: dup @ [a];

pop @ [b];

-- a is still [1, 2, 3]
a;
