-- basic arithmetic

-- PEMDAS works just as you'd accept
-- the arithmetic operators are: ^ * / + - %
-- the modulus operator has the same precedence as + and -

-- this evaluates to 8
4 * 2;

-- this evaluates to 8
2 ^ 3;

-- this evaluates to 8
(1 + 1)^(7%4);

-- this evaluates to 8
16 / 2;

-- since '-' is taken for subtraction, negative numbers are typed by prefixing with '~'

-- this evaluates to 8
9 + ~1;

-- '~' is NOT negation, ~~8 is not 8, it is an identifier
